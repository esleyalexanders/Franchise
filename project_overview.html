        <h1>Franchise Management System - Project Overview</h1>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>This project is a Franchise Management System designed to streamline the operations, subscription, and management of franchise businesses. It provides a centralized platform for franchisors, franchisees, single stores, and staff to manage business processes, subscriptions, and communications efficiently.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>User Roles</h2>
        <div class="roles">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="role">Franchisor</span>: The owner or manager of the franchise brand. Manages franchisees, subscription plans, and oversees business operations at a network level. Does not directly operate franchisee stores.</li>
                <li><span class="role">Franchisee</span>: The operator of an individual franchise unit. Manages their own store, subscribes to plans, and interacts with the franchisor.</li>
                <li><span class="role">Single Store</span>: An independent store owner who subscribes to the platform without being part of a franchise network. Has both the setup/branding functions of a franchisor and the operational functions of a franchisee (e.g., manage staff, quotes, etc.).</li>
                <li><span class="role">Staff</span>: Employees who assist in daily operations, either at the franchisor, franchisee, or single store level, with limited access based on permissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="background:#fff3cd; border-left:6px solid #ffc107; padding:1em; margin:1.5em 0 0.5em 0; border-radius:6px; font-size:1.05em;">
                <strong style="color:#b26a00; font-size:1.1em;">Important:</strong><br>
                <strong>Single Store</strong> and <strong>Franchisor</strong> are both considered tenants in the system, but their functions are different.<br>
                <ul style="margin:0.5em 0 0 1.2em;">
                    <li><strong>Single Store</strong> has initial and necessary functions like a franchisor (e.g., setup branding, products, etc.) and also has full operational functions like a franchisee (e.g., manage staff, quotes, daily operations).</li>
                    <li><strong>Franchisor</strong> manages franchisees at a high level (network, standards, plans) and does not directly operate franchisee stores.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Main Business Purpose</h2>
    <p>The main business of this project is to provide a SaaS platform for franchise and single store management, enabling franchisors to offer subscription-based services to franchisees, and allowing single store owners to manage their business independently. The system automates tenant (franchisee and single store) onboarding, subscription billing, payment processing, and authority management, reducing manual work and improving transparency.</p>
