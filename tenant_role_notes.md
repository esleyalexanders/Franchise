# Tenant Role Notes: Single Store vs Franchisor

- **Tenant Definition:**
  - Both Single Store and Franchisor are considered tenants in the system, but their functions and permissions differ.

## Single Store
- Has initial and necessary functions similar to a Franchisor (e.g., setup branding, products, etc.).
- Also has full operational functions like a Franchisee (e.g., manage staff, handle quotes, daily operations).
- Operates independently, managing their own business as both an owner and operator.

## Franchisor
- Considered a tenant, but with a different focus.
- Manages franchisees at a high level (e.g., oversees network, sets standards, manages plans).
- Does not directly operate or manage the day-to-day activities of individual franchisees.
- Focuses on brand, network growth, and franchisee support rather than direct store operations.

---

**Summary:**
- Single Store = Tenant with both owner and operator functions (like Franchisor + Franchisee).
- Franchisor = Tenant with network management and oversight, not direct store operation.
