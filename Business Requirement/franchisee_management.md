**Feature 1: Create New Franchisee Profile**
*Goal: Allows the Franchisor to initialize an official record for a new franchise unit in the system.*
* **User Story 1.1:** As a Franchisor, I want to create a new franchisee profile by entering basic legal information (company name, tax ID, registered business address) to establish a unique entity in the system.
* **User Story 1.2:** As a Franchisor, when creating a profile, I want to add branch identification details (branch code, trade name, business location) to easily distinguish and manage it. I need Franchisee to fill in unit code, so they can have a sub sub domain. For example, kfc.com so a franchisee that has unit code is "hanoi", their domain will be kfc.com/hanoi

* **User Story 2.2:** As a Franchisor, I want to use a search bar to find a specific franchisee by name, branch code, or city to quickly access their profile.
